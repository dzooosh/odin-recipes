        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and cut the Yam into medium-sized chunks and rinse a couple of times</li>
            <li>Put the Yams inside a Pot, add water just to the level of the Yams and let it cook for 15 minutes on medium to high heat</li>
            <li>Add the pepper sauce palm oil, onions, crayfish, salt, and stock cubes, and allow it to cook for an additional 10 minutes on low heat.</li>
            <li>Add the crabmeat (You can use whatever addition you prefer at this point like, Smoked Fish, Prawns, or smoked Turkey.</li>
            <li>Mash the Yams with a Potato masher or a wooden spoon. I love to mash some yams and keep some chunks. Gives more texture!
                Stir in the parsley (spinach, kale, or ugwu)</li>
            <li>Allow it to simmer for an additional 3 to 5 minutes and enjoy while still hot!</li>
        </ol>
